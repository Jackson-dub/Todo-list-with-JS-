# Todo-list-with-JS-
This is a todo-list  developped with JS. 
The development of this project had the purpose to help me with my trainning in JavaScript. I have learnt with that project how to handle LocalStorage with the JSON method. This allows to save and update new elements from a previous list.
Give it a try and feel free to leave a comment.
